# Project Title: file-share

## Description

Born out of the frustration of trying to seamlessly transfer files between my Android device and Mac. This project is a full-stack file-sharing application that leverages Cloudinaryâ€™s storage solutions alongside the multer node package for efficient file uploading and sharing.

The backend is powered by Express and MongoDB, ensuring robust and scalable performance.

## Features

- File upload and sharing capabilities.
- Integration with Cloudinary for storage.
- Robust backend with Express and MongoDB.
- Elegant and responsive UI with Mantine UI.
- TypeScript for improved code reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js

- Cloudinary account

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository folder]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to both the client and server directories and install dependencies.
